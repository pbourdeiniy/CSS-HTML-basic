/* 
If we want to hide an element temporarily, 
we can use display: none — the browser
removes the element from the layout 
entirely, and it does not take up any 
space. It’s also not accessible to screen 
readers.
If we use visibility: hidden, the browser 
still reserves the space for the element,
but it becomes invisible. It is still not 
interactive and usually not read by screen 
readers.
If we set opacity: 0, the element becomes 
fully transparent, but it still takes up 
space and can still be interacted with 
(clicked, focused, etc.), because it 
remains fully in the layout.
The .visually-hidden class hides the 
element visually but keeps it in the 
document for accessibility. This means 
screen readers can still read it, which 
is important for labels, descriptions, 
or other assistive-technology content.
